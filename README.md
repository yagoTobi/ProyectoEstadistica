## Description

This is a statistical analysis on the stocks for Sony and Gamestop with tickers SNY and GME. We performed this analysis in order to compare the irregularities of GameStop in 2021 compared to the videogame market. 

Upon reflection, this probably wasn't the best election of comparison, as SONY has many other branches aside from videogames as a company which are equally as big. And thus not a reflection of the games industry. Something like EA would've been better.
